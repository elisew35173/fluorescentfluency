	<h1>About Fluorescent Fluency</h1>

	<div class="section">
		<p>Fluorescent Fluency was not built to teach people a language. Rather, it was built to help people find resources that help them address their own specific needs. 
		Fluorescent Fluency was made to help langauge learners to navigate the seemingly endless amount of resources out there. There are so many different books and websites
		that it is hard to know what's quality material. We aim to help clear the water, to provide a clean and accessible database for all of your langauge learning needs.</p>
		<p>You may be thinking, what's with the name? Our lightbulb image symbolizes out goal of shedding light on language learning. It is also a nod to the classic idea of a
		a lightbulb symbolizing a sudden idea or burst of inspiration.</p>
		<p>Even though some resources maybe be placed in only one category, we encourage you to explore on your own. There are hidden gems everywhere.</p>
