	<h1>Why Learn Languages?</h1>

	<div id="section1" class="section">
		<h2>Improve Your Brainpower</h2>
		<p>Learning a second langauge has been shown by mulitple studies to impart coginitive benefits. 
		Bilingualism has been linked to protection against age related coginitve decline and improvements in learning.
		Compared to their monolingual counterparts, older bilingual people enjoyed improved memory and executive control.
		Bilingual Azhiemer's patients have also been shown to have less severe symptoms compared to monolinguals in similar 
		stages of the disease. The benefits of being bilingual can start at as young as seven months, including increased 
		attention conflict management skills.</p>

	<div id="section2" class="section">
		<h2>Increase Your Marketability</h2>
		<p>Having a second language on your resume can do a lot to help both your career and your retirement fund. 
		Between 2010 and 2015 the demand for biligual workers more than doubled, going from 240,000 job postings aimed
		at bilingual workers in 2010 to 630,000 in 2015, and that number is expected to rise. The earnings bonus for an 
		American who speaks more that one language is about 2% a year. That may not sound like much, but that can add up
		to over an additional $50,000 in your retirement fund. </p>
	</div>
	<div id="section3" class="section">
		<h2>Expand Your Horizons</h2>
		<p>Language is deeply intertwined with culture, so much that it is almost impossible to seperate the two. 
		Speaking a second langauge allows you to communicate with anyone who speaks that language. At markets, there 
		are often two prices, one for the locals and one for the tourists. By speaking the local language, you gain a 
		hand up in such interactions. The ability to speak the local language opens many other doors. While tourist spots
		often have English speaking staff, to really experience the local culture, you have to at least know the basics of
		the local language. </p>
